				<h1>GitLab Repository Set-up, About me page customizing, and Sketching the Final project</h1>
				<p>This week I worked on defining my final project idea, but also to set up the GitLab online repository and modifying
					the About Me page to update my previous experiences. </p>

				<h2>Setting the GitLab Repository</h2>
				<p>The first step in creating a GitLab repository is having a GitLab account. Thankfully, FabAcademy gives you the account
					used to access the website as well as an already created repository for you to use. After that, it's just a question 
					of choosing which template you want to use for your website, modifying it to your liking, and uploading. </p>

				<p>After having all the files concerning the content of your repository, I installed the Git programming language from the
					internet and began using GitBash for running the necessary code. Finding the folder I've created is the first step, 
					using "cd <your file address>" can allow you to travel to said folder by using your file address, after that we use the
					"git init" command to initiate the programming in that language, once all the files have been confirmed to be within 
					the folder using "ls" to list the components within the address, we clone the online repository be copying the link 
					provided by GitLab by using the "git clone <the URL given by GitLab here>"</p>

				<p>Then we commit the changes we've done by using the "commit -m "any name here"" that commits a certain part of your files
					to remain unchanged unless you want to update them, allowing to keep logs as time goes on. After that we check the
					status of uploading the local files of our computer to the online repository by using "git status", this will tell us
					what files haven't been "updated or uploaded" to GitLab, using "add .", the computer will update everything within the
					address to the repository, and confirming said action with "push" allows the changes and files to be seen online.</p>

				<h2>Website Customizing</h2>
				<p>Now let's talk about the website. The website was modified from a template to create a customized look. The first step was
					to locate the files within the folder generated in Visual Studio Code, find the section for .css files that regard to the
					website's style, and adjust the colors and spacing to my liking. After this, the site's own contents were modified to 
					provide a different experience than the template initially offered. Images were added, texts with paragraphs were included,
					and certain areas were customized to make the site feel familiar. Once finished, the site had a technological appearance
					with a cyberpunk vibe, showcasing my personal experiences and involvement in specific activities. All modifications were
					made within the files in Visual Studio Code and can be reviewed in the online repository.</p>

				<h2>What about the final project?</h2>
				<h3>Exploration and psychomotor training suit for children with visual disabilities.</h3>

				<p>Being unable to observe and learn from their surroundings causes patients to perceive the external world as risky and 
					threatening, suppressing the need to be active, curiosity, and generating a feeling of rejection towards exploration
					and discovery.</p>

				<p>The project proposes the development of an exploration and psychomotor training suit for children with visual disabilities,
					aiming to help them develop gross motor skills.</p>
				
				<p>This suit would have 2 modes: exploration and training.</p>
				
				<p>The project was initially proposed and conceived by the student Isaac Hortiales Arzate, who is a student at Ibero Puebla and a
					personal colleague. He suggested collaboration to develop this project and take it to a tangible phase to demonstrate its 
					essential functioning. The project will be developed over the coming months, and in collaboration with Isaac, another member
					named Josu√© Reymundo, also a student at the university and a fellow classmate, will join the team.</p>
