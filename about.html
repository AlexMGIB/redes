						<p>Greetings! My name is Alejandro Manrique, student in Mechatronics, one amongs the many members of the FabLab Fab Academy certificate applicants.
							Currently, I study at the Ibero Puebla University in Puebla, Mexico, and with twenty-three years of experience I aspire to have at least twice
							as much of learning and discovery.

				<h2>Previous works</h2>
				<p>In this section you can find some of the previous work I've done so far in the course of all my years as a student.â€‹</p>

				<h2>Project A: Omni-direcctional wheels and suspension</h2>
				<p>	Just last semester. me alongside a team of students built an independent steering system composed of omni-directional wheels complimented by a suspension that can withstand up to 2 kilonewtons of force and 280lbs of additional weight,
					all in order to help guide a "physical assistance vehicle" into a hospital environments and also narrow sections of buildings. All of the vehicle's pieces were manufactured out of aluminum, stainless steel, as well as 3D printing materials.
					All of the aformentioned pieces were designed, manufactured, and assembled within the university's facilities and the system was tested by adding weight to the vehicle, a movement test, and a hardness trial. 
					The results were quite positive and led to various areas of improvement and a prospect of adaptability to allow this vehicle to be used into other indoor environments such as factories, workshops, warehouses, 
					and public areas such as parks.</p>

				<h2>Project B: Graphic Interface design and website development: Sirio Virtual Assistant</h2>
				<p>Almost 2 years ago I participated in the construction of a virtual assistant destined for companies so that they can administer their inventories, employees, and use a system based on byte-sized tasks to complete daily deadlines and increase
				   the efficiency of each task as they were being completed and allowed the administrators of each area of a company to a visualize every aspect concerning proper management of resources, time frames, and events. Personally, I was assigned with
				   the graphic imaging as well as designing the UI of the mobile and desktop app. All of the designs were made using the Figma design platform and Webflow website development tool. Sadly, this project couldn't be completed due to financial
				   restrictions, but fortunately, a beta test was reached, with promising results, if the project is ever resumed. The work the team put in this software showed that there was an easier way to administer one's business and to create one, 
				   getting rid of the myth of unsuccessful startups.</p>

				<h2>Project C: Design, 3D printing and assembly of Universal Robot Arm</h2>
				<p>One of my most recent school projects was the design assembly and testing of a universal robot arm that consisted of materials such as 3D printing filaments, stainless steel gears, rubber belts, and stepper motors as well as a tiny servo-motor.
				   This robotic arm was capable of lifting up to 300 to 400 G of weight with a large amount of freedom of movement and capable of interfacing with a software that allows for complex movement enabling actions such as drawing complex shapes and 
				   replicating certain organic movements. The project was completed within 2 to 3 months of development and delivered incredible results.</p>
